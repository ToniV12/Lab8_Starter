# Lab 8 - Starter

## Check Your Understanding:
1) for our project i would personally like to have it on a github action and locally on my machine so that i can iron out bugs before they get pushed and for added redundancy the action will check again.
2) You should not use E2E testing since it would run over the specific function you are testing and continue to run to completion regardless of output.
3) I don think it would be a good option to use unit testing since theres no way to test if the parts are working together, only if the message was sent to the server, but never if it was recieved by the other person or the server.
4) yes you should use a unit test for that because that is client based and is easy to check using a unit test.
